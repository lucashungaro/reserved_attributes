= Reserved Attributes

Checks all your models looking for attributes (columns) with names that are 
Ruby/Rails reserved words.

The list of reserved words is retreived from http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/ReservedWords and also in a dynamic way (calling Object.methods).

This task won't prevent all errors, but it'll cover the most part.

= Use:
  rake check_reserved_attributes
