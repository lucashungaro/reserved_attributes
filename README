= Reserved Attributes

Checks all your models looking for attributes (columns) with names that are
Ruby/Rails reserved words.

The list of reserved words is retrieved from http://newwiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/reservedwords and also in a dynamic way (calling Object.methods).

This task won't prevent all errors, but it'll cover most of them.

= Use:
  rake check_reserved_attributes
